        <section class="location" id="China">
            <h2>Back to the Roots: China.</h2>
            <img src="images/City CHN.jpg">
            <p>China, holds a special place in my heart since I was born there. My mom had left me when I was born (with my grandparents) until I was 3, to discover Canada to potentially call it our new home.</p>
            <p>This past August (2024) I went with my mom and younger sister to visit my grandparents and other relatives. I unfortunately do not speak any form of Chinese, so it is quite difficult for me to communicate with my grandparents. But, I definitely want to make it a goal to learn how to speak fluently by the time I graduate, so I can go visit once again.</p>
            <p>I would definitely say that I thoroughly enjoyed the trip in hindsight, maybe not in the moment with 35 degree humid weather, but in hindsight...</p>

        <section class="location" id="Japan">
            <h2>Halloween... in Japan!</h2>
            <img src="images/Yoshi JPN.JPG">
            <p>Ah, Japan. I had never really thought about going to Japan to be honest, luckily, it had been my partner's dream to go and she happened to be fluent in Japanese. I just decided to tag along, since the borders had just opened up, I thought why not?</p>
            <p>That trip healed my inner child for sure, but also... drained my bank account with all the claw machines in sight. Plus, in Japan you can actually win these claw games, they're not rigged like some here in Canada.</p>
            <p>Overall, this was a trip I felt like a true tourist and was experiencing culture shock to the fullest, it opened my eyes in a lot of ways. Everything is truly so different to Western society. Witnessing the work culture over there, made me grateful for various opportunities for growth here in Canada.</p>

        <section class="location" id="Ottawa">
            <h2>Where is Home? Ottawa?</h2>
            <img src="images/Ottawa Sign.jpg">
            <p>Ottawa, not what you expected right? Had to end with a bang. At this time of my life, I was undergoing a serious traumatic event and wanted/needed to get out of Alberta. Although I had already moved out once to another city within Alberta, this was the first time I felt truly independent.</p>
            <p>My partner at the time was on a work visa from the UK and also wanted to explore Canada more. She pushed us to move to Ottawa for a bit, so within a week's notice we had packed our bags and were on the first flight to Ottawa.</p>
            <p>My time in Ottawa was short but jampacked with stories. In 3 months, I had:
                <br>1. experienced what it was like to make Montreal style bagels working at a bagelshop
                <br>2. experienced what roofing everyday was like with an extreme fear of heights
                <br>3. gotten mentored on how to tattoo by a tattoo artist
                <br>4. had a stripper as a roommate</p>
                <p>Eventful, to say the least. Another eye opening period of my life.</p>
